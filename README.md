#Rules

#All the folders and the directories have been assigned to for each folder, therefore just edit the mark_up #files.

#Do not use internal css.

#Maintain the naming style of each file.

#Maintain the position and allocation of each external item, icon, image or video and etc.

#This means that all formated files, jpg, png, jpeg, mov, mp4 etc are supposed to be allocated in the assets #folder.

#If you create a new library file example js or css or any format keep it in the appropriate folder.

#All the style have been opended with the file name or file type, example if you are working on a login css #file it is supposed to have, .login-box .user-box, therefore all the items in this file will be called with #that identity name "login-box", see all css files that have been worked on and understand the similarities.

#Do not change the html files to php.
